# Task_Management

I created a simple application for task management. The application allows creating tasks and completing tasks, as well as adding work entries to the tasks. Work entries can be finished, and the user can see the amount of time a task has taken. You can try out the application at https://tasks-app-youssef-haidala.herokuapp.com/tasks

technologies : deno(javascript framework), postgresql, heroku.
